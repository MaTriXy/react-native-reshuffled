## [Unreleased]

---

## [0.2.1] - 2026-03-25

### Changed
- **Breaking:** Public API changed to namespace pattern. `ReshufflableGrid` is replaced by `Reshuffled.Grid`.

  ```tsx
  // before
  import { ReshufflableGrid } from 'react-native-reshuffled'
  <ReshufflableGrid ... />

  // after
  import { Reshuffled } from 'react-native-reshuffled'
  <Reshuffled.Grid ... />
  ```

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-25

### Added
- `allowCollisions` prop on `ReshufflableGrid` — when `true`, dragged items can overlap others and the grid does not auto-adjust positions.
- `getNewGrid` prop on `ReshufflableGrid` — custom callback that overrides the default best-fit reshuffling algorithm, enabling fully custom drop logic (e.g. swap on single overlap, revert on multiple overlaps).
- `onDragEnd` callback — fired after every drop with the updated item array.
- Puzzle demo in the example app showcasing both collision modes side by side.

### Fixed
- Dragged item briefly appeared beneath other items after being dropped.

### Changed
- `ReshufflableGrid` internally split into `ReshufflableGridCore` and `useReshufflableGrid` for better separation of concerns.

- Grid style inconsistencies on certain screen sizes.

### Changed
- Item width and height calculation moved to grid context to avoid prop drilling.
- Cleaned up web exports and removed unused legacy C++ implementations.
